## Papers Implemented

1. **[Trend Analysis of Climate Time Series: A Review of Methods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825218303726)**
   - **Author**: Manfred Mudelsee  
   - **Description**:  
     This paper reviews statistical methods for analyzing climate time series, focusing on trend detection in global climate data. My implementation and commentary include:
       - Traditional and non-linear regression models
       - Change point detection
       - Bootstrap resampling
2. **[Understanding Hyperdimensional Computing for Parallel Single-Pass Learning](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/080be5eb7e887319ff30c792c2cbc28c-Paper-Conference.pdf)**
   - **Authors**: Tao Yu, Yichi Zhang,  Zhiru Zhang,  Christopher De Sa.
   - **Description**:
      This project explores Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), leveraging Random Fourier Features (RFF) initialization and Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA). 

      What I did:
      1. **Implementation**: Developed the HDC method and extended it to the VSA method.
      2. **Experimentation**: 
         - Applied RFF initialization to enhance expressivity.
         - Implemented learning by bundling to create class centroids.
      3. **Comparison**: Evaluated the performance of learning by bundling against results from the paper's SGD-based learning.
      4. **Alternative Similarity**: Replaced cosine similarity with the modular Manhattan distance to explore its impact on accuracy.
